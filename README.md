# NeuralNetTA (PLEASE READ)

This is a Neural Network with 2 hidden layers ,50 neurons on 1st hidden layer and 40 hidden layers. We use python as the language and Theano as the key module for making this neural network, this neural network follows the tutorial on the Theano tutorial. We change a few of the code so it can fit our purpose for our final year project
